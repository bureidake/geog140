<p>It&rsquo;s exam week! Eeek. This time around it is all multiple choice. You will have a total of 100 multiple choice questions spanning covering chapters 5,8, 9, and 10.&nbsp; Each will be worth 1 point. I will divide the multiple choice part of the exam into 2 parts. First part will be chapters 5 and 8 (50 questions with 75 minutes to complete) and second part chapters 9 and 10.(50 questions with 75 minutes to complete).&nbsp; This is in the Mastering Geography system.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you take the exam be aware of the time. The exam does not allow you to go back and forth between multiple choice question questions.&nbsp; In other words once a question comes up you must complete it and submit it. Once the time is up then you cannot answer any more questions. It will grade only the answers you have submitted.</p>
<p>Be sure to take the exam on a computer with the correct browser.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp; it is best not to have any other windows other than your exam&nbsp; open on your computer as this may cause a problem with exam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exam will open&nbsp; today at 6:00 a.m. and close on <strong>April 18th</strong> at 11:00 p.m. Please plan accordingly. (Try and take the exam before the last open day.) If you have problems with the exam make sure you document the problem. Take a screen shot or a picture of the screen with your phone.&nbsp; Contact me enclosing the picture of the problem. I can reset an exam but I will need for you to have proof of a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you fail to take the exam in the time allotted you will need a documented reason for taking a make up exam. The exam will be open for an entire week so the reason will have to be extraordinary.</p>
<p>If you have questions send me an e mail.&nbsp;</p>
