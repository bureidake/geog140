<p>Students at csulb get a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.csulb.edu/academic-technology-services/office-365" target="_blank">free version</a>&nbsp;of office 365. Yes that means you! If you have a Mac or PC you can use office 365. Office 365 is&nbsp; is necessary to listen to the lectures I have recorded in Powerpoint. This may also be helpful to have along with a sign up for one drive 365 later in the course when you work in groups to work on your biome projects. One Drive allows you to share documents with each other.</p>
